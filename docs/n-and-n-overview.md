# Overview

N() is the core method of Natural-JS. It returns a collection of matching elements found in the DOM based on the passed arguments or created by passing an HTML string.

N is the core class where Natural-JS's common functions are defined.

> N() is an object that extends the jQuery() function. Therefore, it can be replaced with $() or jQuery(). However, the local functions of the N object cannot be used in the jQuery or $ object.
