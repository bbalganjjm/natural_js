# Natural-JS

Natural-JS is a JavaScript architectural framework designed to enable intuitive, easy, and fast implementation of user interfaces for enterprise web applications.

## Features of Natural-JS

### CVC Architecture Pattern Based Natural-ARCHITECTURE Framework

Natural-JS provides the Natural-ARCHITECTURE framework based on the CVC (Communicator-View-Controller) architecture pattern.

- **AOP**  
  You can apply AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) to user-defined functions of the Controller object.

- **Communication Filter**  
  It provides a Communication Filter that can filter all data sent and received with the server.

- **Web Components**  
  An architecture for developing pages on a block-by-block basis is provided. These page blocks can be loaded into Tab or Popup contents, page content of Single Page Application (SPA), or Web Component of Micro Service Architecture (MSA).

- **Division of Labor for UI Development**  
  In the UI source code, the development area and the presentation area are completely separated so that the roles of the web publisher and script developer or the back-end developer and front-end developer can be distinctly divided to proceed with the project.

### UI Components for Data Presentation and Rich-UI Development

Natural-JS provides various UI components for data presentation, control, and rich-UI development.

- **Data Processing Components**  
  Provides Grid, List, Form, Select, Pagination, and Tree components that can bind data to elements or control bound data.

- **UI Components**  
  Provides Alert, Popup, Tab, Button, Datepicker, Notify, Documents components that support Rich-UI development.

- **Two-Way Data Binding**  
  Binding the same data to different UI components synchronizes and interacts in real time.

- **Component Design**  
  Component styles can be easily changed, and the common style of the site can be automatically applied to components.

### Libraries for Easy Data Handling

Natural-JS provides libraries for easy data handling.

- **Data Formatting**  
  Provides the Formatter library that allows you to easily format data values.

- **Data Validation**  
  Provides the Validator library that allows you to easily validate input values.

- **Data Utilities**  
  Provides libraries such as filters and sort that can manipulate or process data.
