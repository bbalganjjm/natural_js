# Overview

The Natural-DATA library provides methods and functions for sorting, filtering, and refining data of type JSON object array. This library is an essential part of Natural-JS that helps you manipulate and organize datasets efficiently.

## Purpose of Natural-DATA Library

The Natural-DATA library is designed to:

1. Provide efficient methods for filtering data based on specific conditions
2. Enable sorting of data collections by any property
3. Offer a consistent approach to data manipulation across your application
4. Support both functional and string-based condition specifications

## Key Features

### Data Filtering

The Natural-DATA library allows you to extract subsets of data that match specific conditions. This is particularly useful when you need to:

- Filter records based on property values
- Create views of data that meet certain criteria
- Implement search functionality within datasets

### Data Sorting

You can sort data collections based on any property, in either ascending or descending order. This functionality helps with:

- Organizing data for display purposes
- Preparing data for further processing
- Improving the user experience by presenting data in a logical order

## Integration with Natural-JS

The Natural-DATA library integrates seamlessly with other Natural-JS components:

- It can be used to process data retrieved via the **Communicator** component
- It works well with data that will be displayed in **UI** components
- It can be used in conjunction with the **Formatter** and **Validator** components for complete data handling

## Usage Scenarios

The Natural-DATA library is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

1. **Data Grid Operations**: Filtering and sorting data displayed in tables or grids
2. **Search Implementation**: Implementing search functionality within client-side data
3. **Data Analysis**: Organizing data for analysis or reporting
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Showing only relevant data based on user preferences or application state

By providing these core data manipulation capabilities, the Natural-DATA library helps you build more responsive and data-driven applications with Natural-JS.
